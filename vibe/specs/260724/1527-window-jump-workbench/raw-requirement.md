# Window Jump Workbench — Normalized Requirement

## Intent

Add an opt-in, keyboard-first EyPc surface that lets a user discover interactive desktop windows, save plugin-local aliases and favorites, and jump to a saved target from an EyPc page or from a stable uTools global-shortcut slot.

## Product Decisions

- Support Windows and macOS in the first release. Windows uses top-level desktop-window APIs; macOS uses the System Events accessibility interface.
- The feature is disabled by default. The Tab scans only after an explicit refresh; stable-slot global features use the session live-window cache first and may rescan once on miss. It does not run a background scanner or reload on every Tab enter.
- An alias is EyPc metadata only. The implementation never changes an application window title.
- Ten fixed slot commands, `EyPc 窗口槽 1` through `EyPc 窗口槽 10`, are `mainHide` uTools shortcut targets. Successful jumps do not show the plugin transit window; lost or ambiguous targets open the windows Tab with an exception reminder. Slot labels remain stable when an alias changes, and mappings are separated by platform.
- Window discovery and activation are capability-gated. macOS must explain missing Accessibility/Automation permission and expose a system-settings action; Windows reports a foreground-focus refusal rather than attempting an input or focus-protection bypass.
- A slot first validates its last native reference, then requires an application-and-title locator match. Zero matches report an unavailable target; more than one match present a candidate choice. It must never select one arbitrarily.

## Interaction Contract

- The page is a dense toolbar/list workbench: favorites and slot-bound targets first, then live windows after a manual load. Search covers plugin alias, native title, and application name.
- A persistent slot strip shows aliases for slots `1–10`; clicking focuses the bound target or reports an unassigned slot.
- `ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown` change the active row; `Enter` attempts activation; `ArrowRight` opens the right-side action layer; `ArrowLeft` returns to the list; `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` move between list and action controls.
- `Shift+F2` edits the local alias, `F2` opens the complete target editor, `Ctrl+S`/`Enter` saves, `Escape` backs out from editor to actions to search, `Space` toggles a favorite, and `Ctrl+R` manually loads/refreshes live windows.
- Text fields retain native editing ownership. Window-list shortcuts apply only outside an ordinary editor except for the named editor commands.

## Non-goals and Safety Boundaries

- No public uTools API is assumed for enumerating or activating another application window.
- macOS exposes a session window reference, not an HWND. Only Windows renders and copies an HWND.
- No real window title modification, hidden background polling, simulated input, accessibility privilege escalation, arbitrary external write, or focus-protection workaround is allowed.
- Saved data is limited to user-created target metadata (including a retained target required by a stable slot) and platform-slot mappings in local plugin state. Live window titles remain transient runtime data.

## Acceptance Scenarios

1. Two browser windows with the same title resolve to a user choice rather than an arbitrary activation.
2. A minimized Windows target is restored before foreground activation is attempted.
3. Closing a saved target produces a safe unavailable result and opens the windows workbench from a global slot hotkey; a later unambiguous match may recover it.
4. Renaming an alias leaves a configured uTools shortcut slot intact.
5. Windows reports focus refusal clearly; macOS reports missing permission, then retries after user approval.
6. Editing a target does not intercept native text editing keys.
7. Entering the windows Tab does not scan until the user manually loads or refreshes.
8. After a manual load, a global slot hotkey with a warm cache activates the OS window without showing the EyPc transit window.
